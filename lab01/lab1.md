### 2. Eric Raymond's Smart Questions reading
Suggested additions to section on answering questions:
1. _Provide a brief explanation of why you think the provided solution will work_. A short explanation of why your suggestion will work on the given issue. This might help other users with a similar general issue use parts of your suggestions to solve their problem.
2. _Use alternate terms when applicable_. Sometimes one issue may have different naming conventions, and it may be useful to provide these to avoid duplicate questions (where the only difference is naming of the same thing).

### 3. Chapter 3 of Free Culture by Lawrence Lessig

While the case described in this chapter happened nearly 20 years ago, major industries and individuals are still taking similar copyright cases to court. The RIAA going after Jesse Jordan in 2002 is reminiscent of major labels like UMG going after individual content creators on platforms such as Youtube in 2019. What most strikes me from this piece, apart from the timeliness of it all, is the injustice. The RIAA placed an enormous burden on a student who leveraged a system, but never acted maliciously. I just can't get over the idea of a young student having to surrender his entire net worth in a settlement or risk going in debt for over 10 times his net worth just to get the change to battle a major organization in court.

_Note:_ There aren't many files here, since I am running Ubuntu through Parallels on a MacOS Mojave system.
