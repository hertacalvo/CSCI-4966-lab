# Lab4.md -- Open Source Licensing

### 2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
Licenses are important in Open Source projects to ensure it is clear to all collaborators how their contributions will be used. Licensing also ensures that a project will remain open source in the future, and that monetization practices are clearly outlined as well. Lastly, licensing also allows the project leaders to define the "open-ness" of the project to other collaborators and modifications of the project.

### 3. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
There are no guarantees when it comes to projects without licenses. The whole project could be changed to be closed source without notice, which means there is no guarantee that your contributions will always be available to others. Additionally, someone could monetize of your contributions in ways that are not specified, which wouldn't be allowed to happen under a license.

### 4. Why the Web beat Gopher: Open Systems Model
All in all, I agree with the author's claim that Gopher's failure to follow the open systems model led to its demise. Gopher's centralized model undeniably had a negative effect on its adoption, since it seemed to be harder for a user base to become immersed in a system that did not have a community build around it as free/open software did. Additionally, making the service only free to .edu domains meant that students that used Gopher would migrate to other systems after graduation to avoid fees, rather than sticking with the system they had already used for years.


### 5. Justification of license usage
**System:** Android  
**License:** Apache 2.0  
**Justification:** The Apache 2.0 license lends itself to commercial use, but has protections regarding liability and trademarks. I think this aligns with Android's values, meaning that the platform is open and allows for development of applications that run on Android, and for "flavors" of Android to be made. However, since the Android operating system was created by Google, and multiple large corporation are stakeholders in the project, I believe that the Apache license was a solid choice for them. This is because the license protects the corporations from
being sued if their software is used for malicious purposes, and it allows them to control the trademarked logo to keep the system "on brand".

### 6. Example Project and License choice
**Project:** Email bot that sends memes according to date or day of the week  
**License:** MIT License


### 7. GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD license comparison
**Which license is best for developers, companies and the common good?**  

As I discussed earlier in this lab, I believe that the Apache license lends itself well to commercialization with its general openness and stance on lability and copyright. For developers, I feel like the distinction between GPL and LGPL is useful, since the later is used mostly for libraries, so it seems convenient for developers to have these different licenses for general projects and for libraries. These are best for developers because, even though they do require more documentation than the Apache license, the requirement to include install instructions means more users can install the program and report bugs.  All in all, I think all open source licenses contribute to the common good, but in particular the GPL, since it requires that the install instructions, which increases the accessibility of the project.

### 8. Creating a repository and choosing a license
**Repository URL**  [https://github.com/hertacalvo/test-repo](https://github.com/hertacalvo/test-repo)  

**License:**  MIT License  

### 9. Project, users/customers and license
A project I would choose to work with in this course would be AGENCY, which is a management software for social service organizations. The customers for this project would be social service administrators, with a social work or management background, as well as volunteers in the organization. The license in this project is the GNU GPL, since it is most important to include install instructions that users with non-technical backgrounds can easily set up without assistance.
